				<p class="gallery-quote">Looking down on East Newburgh, urban planners saw blighted buildings, obsolete land-use patterns, and an outdated street grid. The city's population, as well as its tax base, was in decline. The planners' solution to this cluster of problems was to start over from scratch.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="lillian">
				<p class="gallery-quote">This was the logic of urban renewal: Demolition of existing homes and shops was the first step toward transforming a blighted area. Once cleared, small lots could be repackaged into larger parcels for sale to private developers. Those developers would build modern housing and commercial developments. New people (whiter and wealthier than their predecessors) would move into the new homes. New businesses would rent space in the commercial structures. These new businesses and residents would stabilize municipal finances.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class="gallery-quote">In 1964, when Newburgh's city council hired the planning firm of David Rosen Associates, urban renewal was already underway.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="hunters">
				<p class="gallery-quote">The planning firm's job was to assess the "feasibility" of expanding the urban renewal area.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class="gallery-quote">Justifying this expansion was an earlier analysis by real estate appraiser Humes Flynn. In 1961, Mr. Flynn wrote that the earlier Water Street Urban Renewal Project, "is only the beginning. The project will be a miserable failure if a future project does not extend from South Street to Water Street on both sides of Smith  and High Streets, and also should include First Street, both sides of Colden Street and South Water Street from Water Street to Washington Street. These areas must in the very near future be demolished, or whatever is built in the present area will be greatly reduced in value and effectiveness by the condition of the properties in the surrounding areas."
</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class="gallery-quote">The East Newburgh Urban Renewal Area included some of the oldest sections of the city. It was once home to Newburgh’s white elite. That was no longer true by 1960. Between 1950 and 1960, the city’s Black population more than doubled. Many were Southern migrants, part of what is known as the Great Migration. Between World War I and the 1970s, roughly six million African Americans moved from the rural South to the urban North in search of a better life. In Newburgh, these migrants made their homes in the eastern section of the city. (White property owners prevented them from settling anywhere else.) During the same period of time, white city residents moved from east to west or to the suburbs. Federally-backed mortgages facilitated these moves, described collectively as white flight.</p>
